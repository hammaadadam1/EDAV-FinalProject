### **Introduction**

What characterizes a DSI song? 

1. What kind of songs people listen to (audio features of songs) ? 
Parallel coord plot by gender/geography 
2. Geography - where are in 2017/and where you are from - with parallel coords graph



### **Data**

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

data = read.csv('PlaylistNameGenrev2.csv', na.strings = "n/a",
               check.names = FALSE)
gender = read.csv('gender.csv', na.strings = "n/a",
               check.names = FALSE)

summary(gender)
 # Female: 8, 33%
 # Male  :16, 67%
 
data <- gender %>% inner_join(data)

write.csv(data, "PlaylistNameGenreGender.csv")

dim(data)
#2400 rows and  42 columns 
#every row is one song 
#24 unique play lists 


#clean the special characters 
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(artist_name = iconv(artist_name, to='ASCII//TRANSLIT'))

#select the song metrics variables
df <- data %>% select(danceability, energy, loudness, valence, tempo, acousticness, speechiness, instrumentalness, user_id, Name, gender, location2017) 
# did not include liveness,or track_popularity

#normalize track_popularity, loudness, tempo to 0 to 1

df <- df %>%
  mutate(loudness=scales::rescale(loudness ,to=c(0, 1))) %>%
  mutate(tempo=scales::rescale(tempo,to=c(0, 1))) %>%
  mutate(track_popularity=scales::rescale(tempo,to=c(0, 1)))
  

```
We collected "Your Top Songs 2017" playlists of our classmates who filled our survey, and organized it into a desirable format for our analysis.

### **Exploratory Analysis**


We are curious about different audio features metrics of the 2400 songs collected from our survey, and how they correlate with each other and other survey input variables. In particular, we examined the following nine audio features: danceability, energy, loudness, valence, tempo, acousticness, speechiness, and instrumentalness. Most of these metrics have values between 0 and 1, representing the level of each variable (closer to 0 means low and closer to 1 means high), except for loudness and tempo (we normalized their values so that they are also between 0 and 1). We excluded the liveness variable since it detects the presence of an audience in the recording rather than measuring any characteristic of the song. 

The descriptions of those audio features can be found in the table below:
(https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/)

```{r}
library(knitr)

features <- tibble(Feature = c("danceability", "energy", "loudness", "valence", "tempo", "acousticness", "speechiness", "instrumentalness"), 
                   Description = c("Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.",
                                   "Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.",
                                   "Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.",
                                   "Valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. ",
                                   "Tempo represents the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).",
                                   "Acousticness is a confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.",
                                   "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. ",
                                   "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals."))

ggparcoord(df, columns = 1:8, alphaLines = .2,

                                   "Male"), 
                        values = c("Female"="#663399",
                                   "Male"="#66FFFF"))



```

We first took a holistic approach and drew a parallel coordinate plots of all eight audio features of our interest. We think that it would be interesting to see if there are potential clusters among those features conditioned on our survey input variables such as gender and location (in 2017). 

Out of the 24 Spotify users, a third of them are female and the rest are male. Using gender as the "groupColumn" in the parallel coordinate plot above, we observe that each gender's audio feature behavior is different. Specifically, female users tend to listen to music with low acousticness, speechiness, and instrumentalness. In general, all features are spread out in the value range between 0 and 1, except for loudness and speechiness. Consistent with our earlier observation that our DSI cohort likes to listen to loud music. 

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
library(dplyr)

locations <- unique(data$location2017)

df <- df %>%
  mutate(location2017 = as.character(location2017)) %>%
  mutate(location2017_copy = location2017)

df[df=="Chicago"] = "Chicago, USA"

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(country = strsplit(as.character(location2017), ", "))

df$clean_country = NULL

for (i in 1: nrow(df)){
      df$clean_country[i] = last(df$country[[i]])
}

df[,"clean_country"] = fct_recode(df[,"clean_country"], Canada ="CA")

#set all other countries to other if it's not USA
levels(df$clean_country)[!levels(df$clean_country) == "USA"]<- "OTHER"

ggparcoord(df, columns = 1:8, alphaLines = .2, 
           scale = "uniminmax", groupColumn = "clean_country", splineFactor = 10) +
  ggtitle("Patterns: Does country make a difference?  ") +
  theme_minimal(15) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_manual(name="Country in 2017", 
                        labels = c("USA", 
                                   "OTHER"), 
                        values = c("USA"="#FF6666",
                                   "OTHER"="#3399FF"))

# summmary(df)

# clean_country
#  2          -none-     character             OTHER:1200 , 50%
#  2          -none-     character             USA  :1200 , 50%
```

We also drew a parallel coordinate plot with "Country in 2017" as the "groupColumn". We wonder that whether the location of Spotify users affect their music taste. Due to our limited data, we do not have enough country information other than USA, so we decided to group all the other countries into on category called "OTHER". Half of the 24 users are in USA in 2017. The two country groups are more intertwined together compared to the gender groups in the other plot, indicating that that country does not have much impact on users' music taste.

library(pgmm)
library(GGally)
ggcorr(df[1:8], palette = "RdBu", label = TRUE, label_size = 2.5,
size = 3, legend.position = "bottom", hjust = 1) +
  theme_minimal(15) +
  ggtitle("How are audio features correlated?") 


```

After some exploratory and qualitative assessment, we also want to analyze the quantitative relationships among those audio features. The above graph shows the  correlation among each pair of the features. It's not surprising that energy and loudness are the most positively correlated features, while energy and acousticness are the most negatively correlated features.
